# Overview
This project demonstrates a simple microservices spring boot architecture deployed on Kubernetes using Minikube for local development.

### Project Overview
- **Service A**: Retrieves Bitcoin prices in USD from a web API every minute and prints it. Every 10 minutes, it calculates and prints the average price.
- **Service B**: Responds with "Hello Microsoft!" when accessed.
- **Ingress Controller**: Routes traffic to `/service-A` and `/service-B` respectively.
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control is enabled for secure communication.
- **Network Policy**: Service A cannot communicate with Service B.
- **Liveness & Readiness Probes**: Ensures pod health and readiness for both services.

- ### Services
- **Service A**: Runs on port 8083. Endpoint: /api/fetch-btc
- **Service B**: Runs on port 8084. Endpoint: /api/msg

## Cluster Setup

1. **Install Minikube**  
   Follow the instructions from the official [Minikube documentation](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to install and set it up locally.

2. **Start Minikube**  
   Start the Minikube cluster with RBAC enabled:
  
   minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.authorization-mode=RBAC

  

   Deploy Services and Ingress Controller The Kubernetes manifests are included in the k8s directory. To apply them, use the following commands:


kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-a.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service-b.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress-controller.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/network-policy.yaml

Verify Ingress After deploying the Ingress, you can access the services by opening a browser and navigating to:

http://<minikube-ip>/service-A for Service A
http://<minikube-ip>/service-B for Service B

To find your Minikube IP, run:


minikube ip

Build & Deployment
Build Docker Images Navigate to each service directory and build Docker images:

cd service-a
mvn clean package
docker build -t service-a:latest .


cd ../service-b
mvn clean package
docker build -t service-b:latest .

Push Images to Minikube Use Minikubeâ€™s Docker environment to build and push images:

 
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t service-a:latest service-a/
docker build -t service-b:latest service-b/

Deploy to Kubernetes Apply the Kubernetes manifests in the k8s/ folder to deploy the services and configure Ingress:


kubectl apply -f k8s/



Check Services
Verify that the services are running correctly:


kubectl get pods
kubectl get services

Access Services via Ingress
Open your browser and test:


Service A: http://<minikube-ip>/service-A
Service B: http://<minikube-ip>/service-B

Logs
To view logs for Service A (Bitcoin retrieval):


kubectl logs <service-a-pod-name>
